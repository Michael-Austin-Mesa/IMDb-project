# IMDb Project
# Project Description
Analyze text data on movie descriptions and their relationships with the genre of the movie.

# Project Goal
- Explore the effects of the words used in movie descriptions to determine the genre of the movie.
- Construct a ML regression model that accurately predicts a movie genre.

# Initial Thoughts
My initial hypothesis is that drivers of genre will likely be words that are related to that genre.

# Plan

- Acquire data from Kaggle.

- Prepare data by cleaning and lemmatizing text.

- Explore data in search of drivers of genre.

- Develop a model to predict genre.

> Use drivers identified in explore to build predictive models.

> Evaluate models on train and test data.

> Select best model based on highest accuracy.
